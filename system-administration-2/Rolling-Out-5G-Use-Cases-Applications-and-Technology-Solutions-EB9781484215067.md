Book Description
-----------------

 Examine the challenges of 4G in the light of impending and crucial future communication needs, and review the lessons learned from an implementation and system operation perspective with an eye towards the next generation -- 5G. You'll investigate key changes and additions to 5G in terms of use cases. You'll also learn about the applications for and explorations of the technology.
Among all of the technological disruptions, two stand out in particular -- mmWave and spectrum sharing technologies. Rolling Out 5G features detailed coverage of these two critical topics, and for the first time among 5G learning resources presents a holistic perspective on key ingredients for mobile communication in a 5G world.
The authors represent highly experienced experts with valuable know-how in the field of wireless communications related research projects defining future technological trends. This unique group of talents will be able to consider the 5G technology evolution from all angles mentioned: long-term research, standardization and regulation, product design and marketization. This approach allows this much-needed book to capture the views of all key decision making stake-holders involved in the 5G definition process, and to serve readers in their roles connected with wireless communication's next generation of products and services.
