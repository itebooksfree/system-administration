Book Description
-----------------

 We have observed there are five viable and valuable models for IP management         and monetization: IP licensing, technology licensing, developing IP-based component         businesses, establishing contract R&D relationships, and entering into joint ventures to         combine IP assets. By understanding these models and their trade-offs, potential partners         are better able to strengthen their own IP strategies and gain greater access to the         innovations of other companies.
