Book Description
-----------------

 This book will help you get started with agile project management using Microsoft's latest releases of its market-leading Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2015, and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). The book demonstrates agile concepts and how to implement them using TFS/VSTS.
Many organizations are using agile practices today. Agility has become a key enabler for running better projects with more successful end results and high quality output. At the same time, adoption of TFS/VSTS has increased dramatically, from being just a new version control system in the very beginning to becoming the fully-featured market leader it is today.
In order to benefit the most from agile practices you need an Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) toolset that supports your way of working. With TFS/VSTS, Microsoft has provided a powerful tool that is very customizable. This book shows you how you can use TFS/VSTS to implement many agile practices and how they fit into a well-thought-out ALM implementation.
The book also shows how an agile product owner can work with TFS/VSTS to setup an agile project from scratch and how to continue using TFS/VSTS throughout the whole project to track progress, create and refine the backlog, and work with Kanban and Scrum Task boards.
Keeping track of progress is important in any project. TFS/VSO includes many tools which will help you to track key metrics in an agile project. Many useful reports are available out of the box, and the TFS extensibility offers several ways to further customize reporting to fit your needs.
What You Will Learn:
Agile Concepts and Processes
How TFS/VSO supports agile processes end to end
How you can customize TFS/VSO to better support your processes
How to set up an agile project from scratch and manage it over its lifecycle
