What’s stopping you networking? 
You know you need to do it and, like most people, you probably hate it.

Effective networking – both in person and online – has never been more vital. This indispensable, friendly guide will take you step by step through the whole process so you can quickly master:
 Invitations – plan, prepare and make the best of LinkedIn
Meeting people – work the room, feel comfortable and start conversations
Spotting needs – work out what people want, ask the right questions and establish credibility
Reconnecting – follow up, keep in touch and win that pitch
Networking may be necessary, but it doesn’t have to be stressful.
