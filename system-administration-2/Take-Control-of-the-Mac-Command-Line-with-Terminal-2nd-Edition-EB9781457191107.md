-----------------

Learn how to unleash your inner Unix geek!
Updated Feb 2, 2016
If you've ever thought you should learn to use the Unix command line that underlies Mac OS X, or felt at sea when typing commands into Terminal, Joe Kissell is here to help! With this 167-page ebook, you'll become comfortable working on the Mac's command line, starting with the fundamentals and adding more advanced topics as your knowledge increases.
Joe includes 50 real-life "recipes" for tasks that are best done from the command line, as well as directions for working with permissions, carrying out grep-based searches, creating shell scripts, and installing Unix software.
"I found answers to many questions in your book, and I enjoyed reading it. I am definitely more confident now in facing the Mac command line. Thank you for the time and art that you spent to create such a clarifying text."--Mona Hosseini, grad student in Genomic Medicine and Statistics at the University of Oxford
The book begins by teaching you these core concepts:
The differences between Unix, a command line, a shell, and TerminalExactly how commands, arguments, and flags workThe basics of Terminal's interface and how to customize itNext, it's on to the command line, where you'll learn:
How to navigate your Mac's file systemBasic file management: creating, copying, moving, renaming, opening, viewing, and deleting filesCreating symbolic linksThe types of command-line programsHow to start and stop a command-line programHow to edit a text file in nanoWhat a profile is, why it's cool, and how to customize yoursThe importance of your PATH and how to change it, if you need toHow to get help (Joe goes way beyond telling you to read the man pages)You'll extend your skills as you discover how to:
Create basic shell scripts to automate repetitive tasks. Make shell scripts that have variables, user input, conditional statements, loops, and math.See which programs are running and what system resources they're consuming.Quit programs that refuse to quit normally.Enable the command line to interact with the Finder.Control another Mac via its command line with ssh.Understand and change an item's permissions, owner, and group.Run commands as the root user using sudo.Handle output with pipe (|) or redirect (&gt;).Use grep to search for text patterns in files and filter output.Install new command-line software from scratch or with a package manager.Questions answered include:
Which shell am I using, and how can I change my default shell?How do I quickly figure out the path to an item on my Mac?How can I customize my Terminal window so I can see man pages behind it?How can I make a shortcut to avoid retyping the same long command?Is there a trick for entering a long path quickly?What should I say when someone asks if I know how to use vi?How do I change my prompt to suit my mood or needs?What is Command Line Tools for Xcode?When it comes to package managers, which one should I use?"Very good! A pleasure to read, the right balance of coverage and clarity."--Brian G.
Finally, to help you put it all together, the book showcases over 50 real-world "recipes" that combine commands to perform useful tasks, such as listing users who've logged in recently, using a separate FileVault password, figuring out why a disk won't eject, copying the source code of a Web page, determining which apps have open connections to the Internet, flushing the DNS cache, finding out why a Mac won't sleep, sending an SMS message, and deleting stubborn items from the Trash.
