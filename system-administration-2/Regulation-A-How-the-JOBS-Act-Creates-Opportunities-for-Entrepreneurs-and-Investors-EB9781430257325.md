Book Description
-----------------

 "This book is a must-read for all entrepreneurs who need to raise capital to grow their businesses."
—from the Foreword by Bill Hambrecht, Founder and Chairman, WR Hambrecht + Co
"We congratulate the authors for bringing together many of the elements needed to help corporations and their investors take advantage of Reg A+ in a simple and easy-to-understand guide."
—from the Afterword by David Weild IV, Founder and CEO, Weild &amp; Co.; Former Vice Chairman of NASDAQ; "Father" of the JOBS Act
Discover how to raise money under the SEC’s long-awaited Regulation A+ implementing Title IV of the JOBS Act.
This ground-breaking book is the authoritative guide to Reg A+ for executives of emerging growth companies, entrepreneurs, financial advisers, venture capitalists, investment bankers, securities lawyers, and finance and MBA students on how to raise up to $50 million a year through what is in effect a new type of IPO unencumbered by the heavy regulation and cost of a traditional IPO. Reg A+ lifts many of the constraints on soliciting funds, raising growth capital through public offerings, and trading new stock issues that till now inhibited the growth of small companies.
The SEC rules implementing Title III of the JOBS Act by expanding equity crowdfunding to non-accredited investors and allowing small businesses to raise up to $1 million per year have been greeted with speculative excitement in the startup space. But investment banking and stock market heavy hitters such as Bill Hambrecht and David Weild believe that Reg A+ will have a much greater economic impact than the crowdfunding rules and will launch a revolutionary period of growth, innovation, investment returns, and job creation.
Paul Getty, Dinesh Gupta, and Robert Kaplan pool their experience as serial entrepreneurs, investors, and lawyers to show readers in very practical terms how to take maximum advantage of the powerful provisions of the Reg A+ that
• permit companies to raise up to $50 million—a tenfold increase over the old Reg A limit of $5 million and fifty times the crowdfunding limit• allow companies to market IPOs to more people than just accredited investors• make it easier to get the word out on offerings• exempt companies under certain conditions from onerous and costly reporting and compliance requirements, such as Sarbanes-Oxley        Show and hide more
