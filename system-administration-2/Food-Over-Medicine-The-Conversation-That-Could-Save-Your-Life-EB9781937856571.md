Book Description
-----------------

           Includes recipes from Chef Del Sroufe, author of the bestselling Forks Over Knives&#8212;The Cookbook and Better Than Vegan  Nearly half of Americans take at least one prescription medicine, with almost a quarter taking three or more, as diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and dementia grow more prevalent than ever. The problem with medicating common ailments, such as high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol, is that drugs treat symptoms&#8212;and may even improve test results&#8212;without addressing the cause: diet.  Overmedicated, overfed, and malnourished, most Americans fail to realize the answer to lower disease rates doesn&#8217;t lie in more pills but in the foods we eat.With so much misleading nutritional information regarded as common knowledge, from &#8220;everything in moderation&#8221; to &#8220;avoid carbs,&#8221; the average American is ill-equipped to recognize the deadly force of abundant, cheap, unhealthy food options that not only offer no nutritional benefits but actually bring on disease.  In Food Over Medicine, Pamela A. Popper, PhD, ND, and Glen Merzer invite the reader into a conversation about the dire state of American health&#8212;the result of poor nutrition choices stemming from food politics and medical misinformation. But, more important, they share the key to getting and staying healthy for life.   Backed by numerous scientific studies, Food Over Medicine details how dietary choices either build health or destroy it. Food Over Medicine reveals the power and practice of optimal nutrition in an accessible way.              Show and hide more
