Book Description
-----------------

  Continuous Architecture provides a broad architectural perspective for continuous delivery, and describes a new architectural approach that supports and enables it. As the pace of innovation and software releases increases, IT departments are tasked to deliver value quickly and inexpensively to their business partners. With a focus on getting software into end-users hands faster, the ultimate goal of daily software updates is in sight to allow teams to ensure that they can release every change to the system simply and efficiently.   This book presents an architectural approach to support modern application delivery methods and provide a broader architectural perspective, taking architectural concerns into account when deploying agile or continuous delivery approaches. The authors explain how to solve the challenges of implementing continuous delivery at the project and enterprise level, and the impact on IT processes including application testing, software deployment and software architecture.
Covering the application of enterprise and software architecture concepts to the Agile and Continuous Delivery models Explains how to create an architecture that can evolve with applicationsIncorporates techniques including refactoring, architectural analysis, testing, and feedback-driven developmentProvides insight into incorporating modern software development when structuring teams and organizations        Show and hide more
