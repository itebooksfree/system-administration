Book Description
-----------------

 Containers are one of the hottest topics in IT right now, but how are they actually being used? This survey, conducted by O'Reilly Media in collaboration with Ruxit throughout May 2015, invited people from the O'Reilly community to share why and how their organizations currently use—or plan to use—containers. The respondents come from a range of industries, including software, consulting, publishing and media, education, cloud services, hardware, retail, and government, among others.
The results reveal that container technologies—and Docker in particular—are rapidly being adopted to make application deployment faster, easier, and more flexible. If you're considering adopting containers, this report will help you understand why many organizations are moving in that direction and how they're doing it, along with the obstacles and challenges they must overcome.
