Book Description
-----------------


    
    Use policies and Cisco® ACI to make
data centers more flexible and configurable—and deliver far
more business value
Using the policy driven data center
approach, networking professionals can accelerate and simplify
changes to the data center, construction of cloud infrastructure,
and delivery of new applications. As you improve data center
flexibility, agility, and portability, you can deliver far more
business value, far more rapidly.
In this guide, Cisco data center experts
Lucien Avramov and Maurizio Portolani show how to achieve all these
benefits with Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and
technologies such as python, REST, and OpenStack. The authors
explain the advantages, architecture, theory, concepts, and
methodology of the policy driven data center. Next, they
demonstrate the use of python scripts and REST to automate network
management and simplify customization in ACI environments.
Drawing on experience deploying ACI in
enterprise data centers, the authors review design considerations
and implementation methodologies. You will find design
considerations for virtualized datacenters, high performance
computing, ultra-low latency environments, and large-scale data
centers. The authors walk through building multi-hypervisor and
bare-metal infrastructures, demonstrate service integration, and
introduce advanced telemetry capabilities for troubleshooting.
Leverage the architectural and management
innovations built into Cisco® Application Centric
Infrastructure (ACI)

Understand the policy driven data center
model


Use policies to meet the network
performance and design requirements of modern data center and cloud
environments


Quickly map hardware and software
capabilities to application deployments using graphical
tools—or programmatically, via the Cisco APIC API


Increase application velocity: reduce the
time needed to move applications into production


Define workload connectivity instead of
(or along with) subnets, VLAN stitching, and ACLs


Use Python scripts and REST to automate
policy changes, parsing, customization, and self-service


Design policy-driven data centers that
support hypervisors


Integrate OpenStack via the Cisco ACI APIC
OpenStack driver architecture


Master all facets of building and
operating multipurpose cloud architectures with ACI


Configure ACI fabric topology as an
infrastructure or tenant administrator


Insert Layer 4–Layer 7 functions
using service graphs


Leverage centralized telemetry to optimize
performance; find and resolve problems


Understand and familiarize yourself with
the paradigms of programmable policy driven networks
