Book Description
-----------------

 Summary
OpenStack in Action offers the real world use cases and step-by-step instructions you can take to develop your own cloud platform from from inception to deployment. This book guides you through the design of both the physical hardware cluster and the infrastructure services you'll need to create a custom cloud platform.
About the Technology
OpenStack is an open source framework that lets you create a private or public cloud platform on your own physical servers. You build custom infrastructure, platform, and software services without the expense and vendor lock-in associated with proprietary cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. With an OpenStack private cloud, you can get increased security, more control, improved reliability, and lower costs.
