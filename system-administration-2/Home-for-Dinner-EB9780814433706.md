Book Description
-----------------

       Sports, activities, long hours, and commutes—with so much to do,        dinner has been bumped to the back burner.     
            
       But research shows that family dinners offer more than just nutrition.        Studies have tied shared meals to increased resiliency and self-esteem        in children, higher academic achievement, a healthier relationship to        food, and even reduced risk of substance abuse and eating disorders.     
            
       Written by a Harvard Medical School professor and mother, Home for        Dinner makes a passionate and informed plea to put mealtime back at        the center of family life and supplies compelling evidence and realistic        tips for getting even the busiest of families back to the table. Chock        full of stories, new research, recipes, and friendly advice, the book        explains how to:     
            
       Whip up quick, healthy, and tasty dinners • Get kids to lend a hand        (without any grief) • Adapt meals to the needs of everyone—from toddlers        to teens • Inspire picky eaters to explore new foods • Keep        dinnertime conversation stimulating • Add an element of fun •        Reduce tension at the table • Explore other cultures and spark        curiosity about the world • And more     
            
       Mealtime is a place to unwind and reconnect, far from the pressures of        school and work. As the author notes, family therapy can be helpful, but        regular dinner is transformative.
