Book Description
-----------------

 KNOWledge SUCCESSion is intended for executives and developing professionals who face the challenges of delivering business benefits for today, while building the capabilities required for an increasingly changing future. The book is structured to build from foundational requirements toward connecting the highly interdependent aspects of success in an emerging complex world. A wide range of concepts are brought together in a logical framework to enable readers of different disciplines to understand how they either create barriers or can be harvested to generate synergistic opportunities. The insights are robust as and pragmatic to help leaders create an environment in which their teams develop the knowledge and capabilities for sustained strategic success. This book also has extended learning for postgraduate students of business and project management in either an informal or a formal learning context. All successful medium to large organizations now need to have active management of projects and the ability to develop knowledge and capability to drive innovation and maintain relevance. There are detailed books on how to manage projects, texts of knowledge management, and volumes on innovation and change, but there is no one book that brings all these interdependent aspects of success together within the context of projects.
