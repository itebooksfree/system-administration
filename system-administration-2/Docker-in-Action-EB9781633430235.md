Book Description
-----------------

 Summary
Docker in Action teaches readers how to create, deploy, and manage applications hosted in Docker containers.
About the Technology
The idea behind Docker is simple. Create a tiny virtual environment, called a container, that holds just your application and its dependencies. The Docker engine uses the host operating system to build and account for these containers. They are easy to install, manage, and remove. Applications running inside containers share resources, making their footprints small.
About the Book
Docker in Action teaches readers how to create, deploy, and manage applications hosted in Docker containers. After starting with a clear explanation of the Docker model, you will learn how to package applications in containers, including techniques for testing and distributing applications. You will also learn how to run programs securely and how to manage shared resources. Using carefully designed examples, the book teaches you how to orchestrate containers and applications from installation to removal. Along the way, you’ll discover techniques for using Docker on systems ranging from dev-and-test machines to full-scale cloud deployments.
What’s Inside
Packaging containers for deployment
Installing, managing, and removing containers
Working with Docker images
Distributing with DockerHub
About the Reader
Readers need only have a working knowledge of the Linux OS. No prior knowledge of Docker is assumed.
About the Author
A software engineer, Jeff Nickoloff has presented Docker and its applications to hundreds of developers and administrators at Desert Code Camp, Amazon.com, and technology meetups.
