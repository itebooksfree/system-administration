Book Description
-----------------

      The private sector has an important role in poverty reduction in Asia. The Private Sector’s Role in Poverty Reduction in Asia argues that the best way to create sustainable projects is to create win-win situations where both private companies and individuals working their way out of poverty can benefit. The book provides a practical guide for managers and individuals working in the private sector in the least developed areas of Asia to help make a difference to the lives of others. The book’s opening chapter considers the private sector’s role in poverty reduction in Asia and following chapters discuss the variable nature of development, developing economy environments in Asia and business practices and strategies in these economies. A number of Asian economies are considered in turn, including: China; Vietnam; Thailand; Cambodia; Laos PDR; Southeast Asian countries; South Asian countries; Central Asian countries; and the Himalayas. The final chapter looks at creating sustainable win-win situations.Focuses on practical advice for acting managersUses primary research carried out in developing economies, with interviews and ideas from local managers and business ownersCovers a variety of academic theories, empirical evidence and personal experiences of individuals working in the region
