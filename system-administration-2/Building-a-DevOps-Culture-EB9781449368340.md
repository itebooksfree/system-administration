Book Description

DevOps is as much about culture as it is about tools
When people talk about DevOps, they often emphasize configuration management systems, source code repositories, and other tools. But, as Mandi Walls explains in this Velocity report, DevOps is really about changing company culture—replacing traditional development and operations silos with collaborative teams of people from both camps.
The DevOps movement has produced some efficient teams turning out better products faster. The tough part is initiating the change. This report outlines strategies for managers looking to go beyond tools to build a DevOps culture among their technical staff.
Topics include:
Documenting reasons for changing to DevOps before you commitDefining meaningful and achievable goalsFinding a technical leader to be an evangelist, tools and process expert, and shepherdStarting with a non-critical but substantial pilot projectFacilitating open communication among developers, QA engineers, marketers, and other professionalsRealigning your team’s responsibilities and incentivesLearning when to mediate disagreements and conflictsDownload this free report and learn how to the DevOps approach can help you create a supportive team environment built on communication, respect, and trust.
