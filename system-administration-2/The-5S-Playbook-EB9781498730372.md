Book Description
-----------------

 A powerful and effective Lean tool, 5S can help prevent company failure and launch an organization into world-class operational excellence. Until now, however, there has been a need for a book with detailed step-by-step guidelines on how to properly implement 5S (Sort, Set in Order, Scrub, Standardize, Sustain) and the visual workplace. Complete with color images, The 5S Playbook: A Step-by-Step Guideline for the Lean Practitioner fills this need.This new book in The LEAN Playbook Series is your guide to proper 5S and visual workplace implementation. It is ideal for Lean practitioners and facilitators looking for a training tool and a guideline that can be used in the work area while improvements are being made.Like a football coach, you can use this playbook for quick reference to convey whatâ€™s needed to facilitate effective 5S kaizen events. If for some reason you forget a "play" during the 5S implementation, you can easily reference the playbook. You can follow page by page and use the playbook to facilitate a 5S implementation, or you can go directly to certain topics and use it to help you implement that particular "play."The playbook includes color images from actual 5S implementations. In addition to the images, a combination of short paragraphs and bulleted descriptions walk you through each step of an effective 5S implementation.Looking for supplemental information or Lean coaching from Chris Ortiz?
