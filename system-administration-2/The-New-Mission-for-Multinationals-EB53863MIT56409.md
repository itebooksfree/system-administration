Book Description
-----------------

 Not long ago, many observers worried that ever-expanding multinationals &#8212;         many of which had revenues exceeding the gross domestic products of smaller countries &#8212; were         going to take over the world. But as globalization marches onward, powerful local companies         are increasingly winning out against multinational competitors. This is especially true in         emerging markets, where multinationals are assumed to enjoy superiority and CEOs are         counting on growth. In China, the ice cream, laundry detergent and appliance markets provide         interesting examples of this phenomenon. Despite the presence of multinationals in these         markets, the market-share leaders are local companies. A similar pattern is being repeated         in other emerging markets. The authors note, however, that in some cases multinationals have         been able to resist the market gains of local competition, whether through first-mover         advantages or by acquiring the leading local players and nurturing their local identity and         strengths. For decades, multinationals were able to make good returns by acting as efficient         global conduits for assets that were difficult to transfer, including intangibles such as         product designs, technologies, management systems and company cultures. Transfers within the         multinational company were more efficient than obtaining those assets through open-market         transactions. However, a number of forces have been eroding that advantage. First, in the         drive to reduce costs, established multinationals increasingly focused on activities with         the highest returns. This meant that lower-value activities were outsourced and often         offshored to emerging economies, creating global markets in which local companies can also         source components and services. The result is that once-closed value chains have been opened         up, enabling local players to source &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; modules that can be combined to create         products very similar &#8212; and sometimes superior &#8212; to those of foreign multinationals. If         multinationals are to succeed against local competition in emerging markets, the authors         write, they need to move beyond the credo of &#8220;integrate globally and adapt locally.&#8221; They         will need to create new advantages in target markets by integrating their businesses with         the local commercial networks and the society itself. They will need to help shape local         markets, rather than just adapt to them.        Show and hide more
