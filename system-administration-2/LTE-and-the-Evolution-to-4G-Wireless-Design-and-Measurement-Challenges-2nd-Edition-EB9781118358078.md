Book Description
-----------------

A practical guide to LTE design, test and measurement, this new edition has been updated to include the latest developments
This book presents the latest details on LTE from a practical and technical perspective. Written by Agilent's measurement experts, it offers a valuable insight into LTE technology and its design and test challenges. Chapters cover the upper layer signaling and system architecture evolution (SAE). Basic concepts such as MIMO and SC-FDMA, the new uplink modulation scheme, are introduced and explained, and the authors look into the challenges of verifying the designs of the receivers, transmitters and protocols of LTE systems. The latest information on RF and signaling conformance testing is delivered by authors participating in the LTE 3GPP standards committees.
This second edition has been considerably revised to reflect the most recent developments of the technologies and standards. Particularly important updates include an increased focus on LTE-Advanced as well as the latest testing specifications.
Fully updated to include the latest information on LTE 3GPP standards
Chapters on conformance testing have been majorly revised and there is an increased focus on LTE-Advanced
Includes new sections on testing challenges as well as over the air MIMO testing, protocol testing and the most up-to-date test capabilities of instruments
Written from both a technical and practical point of view by leading experts in the field
