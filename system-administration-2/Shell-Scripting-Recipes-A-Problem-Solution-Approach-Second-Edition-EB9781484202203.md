Book Description
-----------------

 
Shell Scripting Recipes is filled with over 150 much-needed and practical recipes that follow a problem-solution format, and help all Unix users regain some of the lost time spent creating and testing shell scripts. Most scripts in this book are POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)-compliant, so they are supported by many of the major shell variants, including Bash, ksh, and sh, among others. This completely updated second edition takes into account the many changes to shell scripting that have occurred since its original publication nearly ten years ago, and all the recipes are now relevant for a modern audience. 
Each real-world example recipe follows the same structure and easily shows you what's going on in each case. File conversion (DOS, UNIX, and Mac), system administration, and resource monitoring are just a few of the topics covered in this highly practical shell scripting reference. You will also find recipes for filename management, complex date calculations, screen control capabilities, and more.
Author Chris Johnson's code is clear, direct, and applicable, and he explains everything well in each recipe so that you understand not just how to do something, but why to do it that way. Shell Scripting Recipes is an invaluable book and one to add to your library today.
