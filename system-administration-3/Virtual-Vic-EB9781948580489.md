Book Description
-----------------

 Virtual Vic is a management fable about the trials and tribulations of a new executive facing the virtual work environment and the technology associated with this environment.The story explores his struggles to be a successful leader by relying solely on technology and ignoring the human touch aspects behind true leadership. The story helps all of us look at technology as the tool it is meant to be rather than the humanistic hindrance it often becomes. Vic meets three characters (his informal Board of Directors) who help provide the lessons needed to best lead a blended workforce. Each character represents a major theme within the book.
The themes of Trust (Reliable Reggie), Isolation (Solitary Samantha), and Presence (Being Bob) are about human perceptions that provide a human touch associated with the virtual work environment. Trust, isolation, and presence are the three main human perceptions discussed throughout the book. Told in a fable style, Virtual Vic can help managers and employees recognize signs that could result in a less-than-ideal work environment. The book is designed for anyone associated with leading or managing teams especially those with the virtual work environment. The lessons discussed allow for the most productive workforce.
