Book Description
-----------------


    
    Continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment are key software delivery processes in a DevOps environment. But what does each one do for your product development and release cycles? In this updated report, Brent Laster explains what these terms really boil down to and how they work separately and together to help your team release software.
This powerful set of disciplines, best practices, and technologies automates the integration and delivery of source code changes from inception through production. Although their implementation may vary, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment are necessary to ensure that software is released frequently, reliably, and with high quality.
You’ll learn how:
Continuous integration makes certain that individual code changes are suitable for inclusion in the code base and merged in successfullyContinuous delivery assembles your product, automatically tests quality and functionality, and produces deliverables that are proven to be deployableContinuous deployment simplifies releasing the product to customers—whether it’s in the cloud, via download, or in some other format—while also allowing for limited deployments or rolling deployments backThis valuable resource for business professionals, software engineering managers, senior developers, and architects will also explore how containers and Kubernetes interact in this environment.
