Book Description
-----------------

Use DevOps principles with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to develop applications and services. This book builds chapter by chapter to a complete real-life scenario, explaining how to build, monitor, and maintain a complete application using DevOps in practice.Starting with core DevOps concepts, continuous integration, and continuous delivery, you’ll cover common tools including Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes in the context of a real microservices application to deploy in the cloud. You will also create a monitor for your cloud and see how to use its data to prevent errors and improve the stability of the system. By the end of Pro DevOps with Google Cloud Platform, you will be able to deploy, maintain, and monitor a real application with GCP.What You Will LearnBuild and deploy applications and services using DevOps on Google Cloud Platform Maintain a complete continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelineUse containerization with Docker and KubernetesCarry out CD with GCP and JenkinsCreate microservices with Jenkins, Docker, and KubernetesMonitor your newly deployed application and its deployment and performanceSet up security and manage your network with GCP Who This Book Is ForDevelopers and software architects who want to implement DevOps in practice. Some prior programming experience is recommended as well as a basic knowledge of a Linux command-line environment.
