Book Description
-----------------


    
    Speak for Yourself
Do you yearn for a book to disambiguate the common language of your job? Do you wish the kimono would open on idioms and clichés that stretch the bandwidth of understanding and make you wonder if your career is scalable? Maybe you want someone to:
Take off the kid gloves. Be aboveboard. Give you the blow-by-blow. Help you move the needle. If so, then The BS Dictionary: Uncovering the Origins and True Meanings of Business Speak is for you!  
Join authors Bob Wiltfong and Tim Ito as they take humorous aim at the common words and phrases of business. The dictionary has been used as a tool for social commentary and amusement for centuries, and the authors don’t disappoint with their version, as they follow in the hallowed footsteps of Samuel Johnson, Ambrose Bierce, and Gustave Flaubert to succinctly reveal us to ourselves. The authors’ researched and documented entries include definitions and a full etymology of favorite phrases like back of the envelope, boil the ocean, elephant in the room, and FAQ. This unique book will amuse and nudge business speakers as well as educate those who don’t yet speak B.S.
