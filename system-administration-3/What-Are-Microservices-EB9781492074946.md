Book Description
-----------------

 Microservices have become an increasingly popular architecture choice over the past five years. With the ability to deliver software faster and support newer technologies, these independently releasable services give software architects, programmers, and developers more freedom to react, make different decisions, and respond faster to change. In this report, you’ll explore the benefits of microservices and their limitations.
You’ll learn what microservices are, how they work, and why this approach is different than other ways of decomposing your architecture. Author Sam Newman (Building Microservices, Monolith to Microservices) explains that while many companies have shown how effective microservices can be, this architecture also adds a lot of complexity to your system. This report helps you determine if microservices are right for your organization.
Learn the key concepts of a microservices architectureExamine microservice advantages, including robustness, scaling, and ease of deploymentContrast microservices with single-process, modular, and distributed monolithsExplore enabling technologies such as containers and Kubernetes, streaming, public cloud, and serverlessUnderstand microservice pain points: technology overhead, monitoring and troubleshooting, security, and data consistencyLearn situations where microservices work well—and situations where they don’t        Show and hide more
