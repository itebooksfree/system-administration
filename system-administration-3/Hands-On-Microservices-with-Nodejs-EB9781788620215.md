Book Description
-----------------

 Understand microservice concepts while learning to develop with Express, deploy with Docker, and scale with Swarm and Kubernetes using Node 10
About This BookWrite clean and maintainable code with JavaScript for better microservices developmentBuild Cloud Native microservices using just Node and ExpressDevelop smart, efficient, and fast enterprise-grade microservices implementationWho This Book Is ForHands-On Microservices with Node.js is for anyone who knows the basics of Node.js, wants to enter the world of microservices, and learn why they're so popular. It is also useful if you're a microservices developer using other languages.
What You Will LearnLearn microservice conceptsExplore different service architectures, such as Hydra and SenecaUnderstand how to use containers and the process of testingUse Docker and Swarm for continuous deployment and scalingLearn how to geographically spread your microservicesDeploy a cloud-native microservice to an online providerKeep your microservice independent of online providersIn DetailMicroservices enable us to develop software in small pieces that work together but can be developed separately; this is one reason why enterprises have started embracing them. For the past few years, Node.js has emerged as a strong candidate for developing microservices because of its ability to increase your productivity and the performance of your applications.
Hands-On Microservices with Node.js is an end-to-end guide on how to dismantle your monolithic application and embrace the microservice architecture - right from architecting your services and modeling them to integrating them into your application. We'll develop and deploy these microservices using Docker. Scalability is an important factor to consider when adding more functionality to your application, and so we delve into various solutions, such as Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, to scale our microservices. Testing and deploying these services while scaling is a real challenge; we'll overcome this challenge by setting up deployment pipelines that break up application build processes in several stages. Later on, we'll take a look at serverless architecture for our microservices and its benefits against traditional architecture. Finally, we share best practices and several design patterns for creating efficient microservices.
Style and approachThis end-to-end guide will help readers understand the concepts of microservices by picking a microservice example and developing it from start to finish.
