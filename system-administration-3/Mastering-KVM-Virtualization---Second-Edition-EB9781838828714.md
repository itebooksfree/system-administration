Book Description
-----------------

Learn how to configure, automate, orchestrate, troubleshoot, and monitor KVM-based environments capable of scaling to private and hybrid cloud models
Key FeaturesGain expert insights into Linux virtualization and the KVM ecosystem with this comprehensive guideLearn to use various Linux tools such as QEMU, oVirt, libvirt, Cloud-Init, and Cloudbase-InitScale, monitor, and troubleshoot your VMs on various platforms, including OpenStack and AWSKernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) enables you to virtualize your data center by transforming your Linux operating system into a powerful hypervisor that allows you to manage multiple operating systems with minimal fuss. With this book, you'll gain insights into configuring, troubleshooting, and fixing bugs in KVM virtualization and related software.
This second edition of Mastering KVM Virtualization is updated to cover the latest developments in the core KVM components - libvirt and QEMU. Starting with the basics of Linux virtualization, you'll explore VM lifecycle management and migration techniques. You'll then learn how to use SPICE and VNC protocols while creating VMs and discover best practices for using snapshots. As you progress, you'll integrate third-party tools with Ansible for automation and orchestration. You'll also learn to scale out and monitor your environments, and will cover oVirt, OpenStack, Eucalyptus, AWS, and ELK stack. Throughout the book, you'll find out more about tools such as Cloud-Init and Cloudbase-Init. Finally, you'll be taken through the performance tuning and troubleshooting guidelines for KVM-based virtual machines and a hypervisor.
By the end of this book, you'll be well-versed with KVM virtualization and the tools and technologies needed to build and manage diverse virtualization environments.
