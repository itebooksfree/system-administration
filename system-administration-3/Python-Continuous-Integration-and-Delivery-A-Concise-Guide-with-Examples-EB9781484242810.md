Book Description
-----------------

 Gain the techniques and tools that enable a smooth and efficient software development process in this quick and practical guide on Python continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). Based on example applications, this book introduces various kinds of testing and shows you how to set up automated systems that run these tests, and install applications in different environments in controlled ways. Python Continuous Integration and Delivery tackles the technical problems related to software development that are typically glossed over in pure programming texts.After reading this book, you’ll see that in today's fast-moving world, no software project can afford to go through development, then an integration phase of unpredictable length and complexity, and finally be shipped to the customer -- just to find out that the resulting application didn't quite fill their need. Instead, you’ll discover that practicing continuous integration and continuous delivery reduces the risks by keeping changes small and automating otherwise painful processes. What You Will LearnCarry out various kinds of testing, including unit testing and continuous integration testing, of your Python code using JenkinsBuild packages and manage repositoriesIncorporate Ansible and Go for automated packaging and other deploymentsManage more complex and robust deploymentsWho This Book Is ForPython programmers and operating staff that work with Python applications.
