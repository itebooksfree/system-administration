Book Description
-----------------

 Use this book as your one-stop shop for architecting a world-class DevOps environment with Microsoft technologies.
.NET DevOps for Azure is a synthesis of practices, tools, and process that, together, can equip a software organization to move fast and deliver the highest quality software. The book begins by discussing the most common challenges faced by developers in DevOps today and offers options and proven solutions on how to implement DevOps for your team.
Daily, millions of developers use .NET to build and operate mission-critical software systems for organizations around the world. While the marketplace has scores of information about the technology, it is completely up to you to put together all the blocks in the right way for your environment.
This book provides you with a model to build on. The relevant principles are covered first along with how to implement that part of the environment. And while variances in tools, language, or requirements will change the needed implementation, the DevOps model is the architecture for the working environment for your team. You can modify parts of the model to customize it to your enterprise, but the architecture will enable all of your teams and applications to accelerate in performance.
