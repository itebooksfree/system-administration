Book Description
-----------------

 There’s more to chaos engineering than deliberately breaking stuff in production. With this book, QA engineers as well as program and product managers will examine the theory, history, and implementation of this full-fledged software engineering discipline. Chaos experts Casey Rosenthal and Nora Jones will bring you up to speed on this practice for finding failures within your application, network, and infrastructure.
As the software industry continues to move toward microservices and other complex, distributed systems, fewer people are able to hold a working picture of the entire system in their minds. Complexity can’t be removed from these systems, but new methodologies allow engineers to navigate the complexity while optimizing for business goals such as feature velocity, performance, and fault tolerance. This book guides you through chaos engineering and demonstrates how this methodology can help you optimize for availability.
