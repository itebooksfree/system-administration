Book Description
-----------------

      Create your own LoRa wireless projects for non-industrial use and gain a strong basic understanding of the LoRa technology, LoRa WAN, and LPWAN. You'll start by building your first LoRa wireless channel and then move on to various interesting projects such as setting up networks with a LoRa gateway, communicating with IoT servers using RESTful API and MQTT protocol, and real-time GPS tracking. With LoRa wireless and LoRaWAN, you can build a wide array of applications in the area of smart agriculture, smart cities, smart environment, smart healthcare, smart homes and buildings, smart industrial control, smart metering, smart supply chain and logistics. Beginning LoRa Radio Networks with Arduino provides a practical introduction and uses affordable and easy to obtain hardware to build projects with the Arduino development environment.What You’ll LearnUnderstand the hardware need to build LoRaWANUse the Arduino development environment to write codeConnect to Arduino hardware and upload programs and communicate with themSetup networks with LoRa gatewayShow real time track with tail, and path historyWho This Book Is ForInventors, hackers, crafters, students, hobbyists, and scientists           Show and hide more
