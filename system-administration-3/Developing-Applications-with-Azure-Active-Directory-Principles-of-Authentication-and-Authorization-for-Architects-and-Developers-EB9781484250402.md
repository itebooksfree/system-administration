Book Description
-----------------

 Explore tools for integrating resources and applications with Azure Active Directory for authentication and authorization. This book starts with an introduction to Azure Active Directory (AAD) where you will learn the core concepts necessary to understand AAD and authentication in general. You will then move on to learn OpenID Connect and OAuth along with its flows, followed by a deep dive into the integration of web applications for user-based authentication. Next, you go through user authentication and how to enable the integration of various native applications with AAD. This is followed by an overview of authenticating applications along with a detailed discussion on collaboration with external users and other AD tenants. Moving forward, Developing Applications with Azure Active Directory covers using schemas of AD objects, such as users, to add custom attributes on top of ADD’s predefined attributes. You will see how multi-tenancy can be supported in Azure AD as well as how to design authorization with Azure AD.After reading this book, you will be able to integrate, design, and develop authentication and authorization techniques in Azure Active Directory.What You Will LearnIntegrate applications with Azure AD for authenticationExplore various Azure AD authentication scenariosMaster core Azure AD conceptsIntegrate external users and tenants
