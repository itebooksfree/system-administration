Book Description
-----------------

 Why are so many companies embracing cloud native development? Getting new features into the hands of demanding customers requires a faster and more efficient approach than traditional development methods. The most successful organizations today use cloud native to develop innovative software products and services with speed and scalability not possible with the static waterfall development method.
In this ebook, Bill Laberis explores cloud native by defining various interrelated elements of this approach. By learning terms such as DevOps, microservices, and continuous delivery, you’ll understand why cloud native is much more about how applications are built and deployed than where. This ebook includes case studies of how the Financial Times, Volkswagen, ASOS, and DISH adopted cloud native.
You’ll examine cloud native practices and components such as:
DevOps: Practices for removing barriers between development and operationsContinuous delivery, continuous upgrades, and automated scalability: Practices vital to DevOps successContainers, including Docker: A method for bundling software and its dependencies into one packageKubernetes: A tool for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applicationsOrchestration: Automated configuration, coordination, and management of cloud systems, resources, and softwareMicroservices: Architecture for building applications as a collection of services or protocols        Show and hide more
