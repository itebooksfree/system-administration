Book Description
-----------------

 Follow this step-by-step guide for creating a continuous delivery pipeline using all of the new features in Jenkins 2.0 such as Pipeline as a Code, multi-branch pipeline, and more. You will learn three crucial elements for achieving a faster software delivery pipeline: a fungible build/test environment, manageable and reproducible pipelines, and a scalable build/test infrastructure. Pro Continuous Delivery demonstrates how to create a highly available, active/passive Jenkins server using some niche technologies.What You'll LearnCreate a highly available, active/passive Jenkins server using CoreOS and Docker, and using Pacemaker and CorosyncUse a Jenkins multi-branch pipeline to automatically perform continuous integration whenever there is a new branch in your source control systemDescribe your continuous delivery pipeline with JenkinsfileHost Jenkins server on a cloud solutionRun Jenkins inside a container using DockerDiscover how the distributed nature of Git and the “merge before build” feature of Jenkins can be used to implement gated check-inImplement a scalable build farm using Docker and KubernetesWho This Book Is ForYou have experience implementing continuous integration and continuous delivery using Jenkins freestyle Jobs and wish to use the new Pipeline as a Code feature introduced in Jenkins 2.0Your source code is on a Git-like version control system (Git, GitHub, GitLab, etc.) and you wish to leverage the advantages of a multi-branch pipeline in JenkinsYour infrastructure is on a Unix-like platform and you wish to create a scalable, distributed build/test farm using Docker or KubernetesYou are in need of a highly available system for your Jenkins Server using open source tools and technologies        Show and hide more
