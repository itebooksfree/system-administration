Book Description
-----------------

Tips rule!
Have you ever noticed that in just about every Mac book, the author will include a couple of tips in each chapter (you'll usually find them in the sidebar, or at the bottom of the page in a tinted box). Sometimes it's a shortcut, a faster way to do something, or a clever workaround that just makes your life easier. People really love those tips, but there's only one problem--there's never enough of them.
That's why Scott Kelby, bestselling author and Editor-in-Chief of Mac Design magazine came up with the idea to create a book that’s nothing but “sidebar” tips. That's right--this entire book, cover-to-cover is packed with nothing but those cool inside secrets, slick workarounds, undocumented shortcuts, and sneaky little tricks that will make you faster, better, and have more fun using Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger).
Nothing but the tips!
You're not going to find complicated descriptions on how to configure a network, how to partition a hard drive, or lines and lines of scary-looking UNIX code--instead this book is nothing but cool tips--and it's all written in Scott's casual, plain English style so you can start using these tips today. Plus, this book does the standard "sidebar tip" one better by including a clear screen capture with nearly every tip, so you can see exactly how it's all done.
Not just tips. Killer tips!
To be in this book, every tip has got to be a "Killer Tip" (the kind of tip that makes you nod and smile, then call all your Mac buddies to tune them up with your new-found power). Scott’s a total "hip hound" (in fact, it was Scott who created the entire smash-bestselling "Killer Tips" book series), and he doesn't hold anything back--it's all here from the man who literally "wrote the book" on cool productivity tips.If you like doing things the easy way, if you like getting twice the work done in half the time, and if you get a kick out of knowing all the "inside secrets and undocumented shortcuts" that will wow your friends and coworkers, you're absolutely going to love this book.
