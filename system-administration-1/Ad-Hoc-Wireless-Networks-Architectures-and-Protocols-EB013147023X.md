Book Description
-----------------

Practical design and performance solutions for every ad hoc wireless network
Ad Hoc Wireless Networks comprise mobile devices that use wireless transmission for communication. They can be set up anywhere and any time because they eliminate the complexities of infrastructure setup and central administration-and they have enormous commercial and military potential. Now, there's a book that addresses every major issue related to their design and performance. Ad Hoc Wireless Networks: Architectures and Protocols presents state-of-the-art techniques and solutions, and supports them with easy-to-understand examples. The book starts off with the fundamentals of wireless networking (wireless PANs, LANs, MANs, WANs, and wireless Internet) and goes on to address such current topics as Wi-Fi networks, optical wireless networks, and hybrid wireless architectures. Coverage includes:
Medium access control, routing, multicasting, and transport protocols
QoS provisioning, energy management, security, multihop pricing, and much more
In-depth discussion of wireless sensor networks and ultra wideband technology
More than 200 examples and end-of-chapter problems
Ad Hoc Wireless Networks is an invaluable resource for every network engineer, technical manager, and researcher designing or building ad hoc wireless networks.
