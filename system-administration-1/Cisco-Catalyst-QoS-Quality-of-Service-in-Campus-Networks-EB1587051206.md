Book Description
-----------------


    
    End-to-end QoS deployment techniques for Cisco Catalyst series
switches
Examine various QoS components, including congestion
management, congestion avoidance, shaping, policing/admission
control, signaling, link efficiency mechanisms, and classification
and marking
Map specified class of service (CoS) values to various queues
and maintain CoS values through the use of 802.1q tagging on the
Cisco Catalyst 2900XL, 3500XL and Catalyst 4000 and 2948G/2980G
CatOS Family of Switches
Learn about classification and rewrite capabilities and queue
scheduling on the Cisco Catalyst 5000
Implement ACLs, ACPs, ACEs, and low-latency queuing on the
Cisco Catalyst 2950 and 3550 Family of Switches
Understand classification, policying, and scheduling
capabilities of the Catalyst 4000 and 4500 IOS Family of
Switches
Configure QoS in both Hybrid and Native mode on the Catalyst
6500 Family of Switches
Utilize Layer 3 QoS to classify varying levels of service with
the Catalyst 6500 MSFC and Flexwan
Understand how to apply QoS in campus network designs by
examining end-to-end case studies
Quality of service (QoS) is the set of techniques designed to
manage network resources. QoS refers to the capability of a network
to provide better service to selected network traffic over various
LAN and WAN technologies. The primary goal of QoS is to provide
flow priority, including dedicated bandwidth, controlled jitter and
latency (required by some interactive and delay-sensitive traffic),
and improved loss characteristics.
While QoS has become an essential technology for those
organizations rolling out a new generation of network applications
such as real-time voice communications and high-quality video
delivery, most of the literature available on this foundation
technology for current and future business applications focuses on
IP QoS. Equally important is the application of QoS in the campus
LAN environment, which is primarily responsible for delivering
traffic to the desktop.
Cisco Catalyst QoS is the first book to concentrate
exclusively on the application of QoS in the campus environment.
This practical guide provides you with insight into the operation
of QoS on the most popular and widely deployed LAN devices: the
Cisco Catalyst family of switches. Leveraging the authors'
extensive expertise at Cisco in the support of Cisco Catalyst
switches and QoS deployment, the book presents QoS from the campus
LAN perspective. It explains why QoS is essential in this
environment in order to achieve a more deterministic behavior for
traffic when implementing voice, video, or other delay-sensitive
applications. Through architectural overviews, configuration
examples, real-world deployment case studies, and summaries of
common pitfalls, you will understand how QoS operates, the
different components involved in making QoS possible, and how QoS
can be implemented on the various Cisco Catalyst platforms to
enable truly successful end-to-end QoS applications.
This book is part of the Networking Technology Series from Cisco
Press, which offers networking professionals valuable information
for constructing efficient networks, understanding new
technologies, and building successful careers.
