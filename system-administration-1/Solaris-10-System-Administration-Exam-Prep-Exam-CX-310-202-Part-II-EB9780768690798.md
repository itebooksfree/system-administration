Book Description
-----------------

Solaris 10 System Administration Part II
Exam CX-310-202
Bill Calkins
In this book you’ll learn Advanced Topics in Solaris 10
System Administration for SPARC and x86-based systems including:
Administering the network environment in Solaris 10
Setting up RAID metadevices using SVM
Configuring ZFS storage pools and file systems
Configuring and administering Solaris zones and containers
Administering virtual file systems and swap space
Creating and administering user and Role-Based access accounts (RBAC)
Using advanced installation tools to install, clone, and upgrade the operating system
Bill’s original Cert Prep guides were used throughout Sun’s service organization as the SEs studied for Certification. This was not mandated by Sun management but happened through word-of-mouth by those software engineers who had successfully passed the exam. In this new edition, Bill adds a chapter for ZFS. It includes Live Upgrade conversion to a ZFS root filesystem and Zone/ZFS inter-operation. Plus, all chapters have been updated to reflect the Solaris 10 10/08 enhancements. This new guide remains the best source of preparation for the Solaris 10 Cert exam.
