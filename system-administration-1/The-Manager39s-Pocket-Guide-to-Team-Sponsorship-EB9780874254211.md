Book Description
-----------------

Are you responsible for starting new teams, providing direction, allocating resources, removing roadblocks, and serving as an all-around champion for high-performance work teams? This practical, step-by-step guide is for you! Not only does this pocket reference emphasize the importance of turning slogans and talk into action, it tells how to do it. You'll get helpful guidelines for turning the principles of team management into day-to-day actions. Each chapter begins with a set of questions that the sponsor must ask before starting any team. The answers to these questions provide the keys to whether the project or activity actually warrants the effort that goes into a successful team. Once the need for the team has been clearly established, a checklist outlines the necessary actions the sponsor must take to successfully start and maintain the team. The remainder of each chapter provides the details and specific instructions for carrying out the activities on the checklist. Many of the steps include exercises, activities, or assignments to enhance the learning points. Covers the most common types of teams and team support elements.
