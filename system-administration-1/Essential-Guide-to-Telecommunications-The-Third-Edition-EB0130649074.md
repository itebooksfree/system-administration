What readers of the previous editions had to say:
 "With jargon-free definitions, clear schematic drawings and its steady narrative drive,The Essential Guide to Telecommunications is a reassuring testament to the human ability to comprehend and communicate at some fundamental level even the most bewildering technology." 
—David Warsh, The Boston Globe
 "This book cuts through all the jargon and mysterious acronyms to give easily understood explanations of telecommunications, from the basics to the latest technology. I refer to it on a regular basis and constantly recommend it to others." 
—Michael Rieke, Editor of the Dow Jones Bandwidth Intelligence Alert
 "It is fair to say that Annabel Dodd has done more to demystify the industry for more people than anyone else in Massachusetts. For those who don't know bandwidth from a band saw or optical networks from an ophthalmologist, Dodd's book offers valuable insights into the products and services that fall under the telecommunications umbrella." 
—Katherine Raphaelson, Director, Massachusetts Telecommunications Council
 "This book is written for those who have little or no technical background. It's an easy-to-read overview of much of the technology available now and great if you have no patience for technical terminology." 
—George Runkle, The Motley Fool, Inc.
