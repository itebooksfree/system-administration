Book Description
-----------------

Open source provides the competitive advantage in the Internet Age.  According to the August Forrester Report, 56 percent of IT managers  interviewed at Global 2,500 companies are already using some type of  open source software in their infrastructure and another 6 percent will  install it in the next two years. This revolutionary model for  collaborative software development is being embraced and studied by  many of the biggest players in the high-tech industry, from Sun  Microsystems to IBM to Intel.The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar is a must for anyone who cares  about the future of the computer industry or the dynamics of the  information economy. Already, billions of dollars have been made and  lost based on the ideas in this book. Its conclusions will be studied,  debated, and implemented for years to come. According to Bob Young,  "This is Eric Raymond's great contribution to the success of the open  source revolution, to the adoption of Linux-based operating systems,  and to the success of open source users and the companies that  supply them."The interest in open source software development has grown  enormously in the past year. This revised and expanded paperback  edition includes new material on open source developments in 1999 and  2000. Raymond's clear and effective writing style accurately describing  the benefits of open source software has been key to its  success. With major vendors creating acceptance for open source  within companies, independent vendors will become the open source  story in 2001.
