Book Description
-----------------

You bought your Mac OS X Tiger computer because you thought it would be easy to use-and it is! But if you've never used a computer before, never stared at a graphical user interface or clicked an icon to launch a program or open a file, getting going with your new machine can still be a daunting proposition. With this guide from legendary author Scott Kelby, it doesn't have to be! Realizing there are still plenty of novice users just like yourself whose Macs represent their very first foray into personal computing, this guide provides a simple, practical approach guaranteed to get you sending email, going on the Internet, creating Word documents, and more immediately with Mac OS X Tiger. Focused lessons take you step-by-step through all of the tasks you're most eager to tackle with your Mac OS X Tiger machine (in the order you're likely to approach them): using the mouse, going on the Internet, sending email, initiating iChat sessions, creating address books and calendars, importing and sharing photos, making play lists and burning CDs, synching music with your iPod, launching and saving Word documents, using search (Spotlight), organizing files, and more.
