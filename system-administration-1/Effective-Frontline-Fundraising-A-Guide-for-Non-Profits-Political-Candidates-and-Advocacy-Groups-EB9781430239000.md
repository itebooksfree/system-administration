Book Description
-----------------

Today, nearly every charitable nonprofit, advocacy group, professional group, and politician relies on the philanthropy of others. Whether it's a private college, a hospital or museum, a lobbying group, or a local, low-budget food shelf, operational and marketing costs and capital investments are often largely underwritten through the generous support of donors. Nonprofits need some people to write $25 checks on a regular basis, and they need others to make six-figure pledges. The bad news: Since the economic collapse of 2008, getting people to part with precious dollars has become ever more difficult. The good news is that people are still inclined to be generous to organizations, causes, and candidates they believe in. Effective Frontline Fundraising provides the information you'll need to set up and manage an effective development team capable of consistently raising gifts, both large and small.
Effective Frontline Fundraising will not only teach those skills for getting the gift you want in the short run, but it will also show how to build a meaningful, long-lasting relationship between your organization and your donor base. This book:
Shows how to keep that organizational lifeblood—cash—running through your vital operations
Explains how to create a firm foundation from which to solicit funds
Provides examples of successful and unsuccessful fundraising messages and plans
Teaches you how to ask confidently for gifts from $25 to $1,000,000 ... or more!
What you'll learn
You will learn to:
Recruit a rock-solid development team
Devise and implement an annual fundraising plan
Craft a motivating fundraising message
Time your solicitations to maximize return
Maintain positive relationships with your donor base
Gain an understanding of the gift cycle
Leverage volunteers, events, and other development resources and opportunities
Build the confidence to make the "big ask" for major gifts
Who this book is for
Effective Frontline Fundraising is geared toward small to medium nonprofits that are just beginning to professionalize their development offices. It is for new directors of development/institutional advancement who need to build an operation from the ground up. It is for anyone raising funds for political organizations, individual candidates for public office, and advocacy groups. And it is for fundraising professionals who are just about to go after the big fish.
