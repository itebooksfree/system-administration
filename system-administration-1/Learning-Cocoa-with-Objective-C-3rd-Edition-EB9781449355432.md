Book Description
-----------------

Get up to speed on Cocoa and Objective-C, and start developing applications on the iOS and OS X platforms. If you don’t have experience with Apple’s developer tools, no problem! From object-oriented programming to storing app data in iCloud, this book covers everything you need to build apps for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
You’ll learn how to work with the Xcode IDE, Objective-C’s Foundation library, and other developer tools such as Event Kit framework and Core Animation. Along the way, you’ll build example projects, including a simple Objective-C application, a custom view, a simple video player application, and an app that displays calendar events for the user.
Learn the application life cycle on OS X and iOSWork with the user-interface system in Cocoa and Cocoa TouchUse AV Foundation to display video and audioBuild apps that let users create, edit, and work with documentsStore data locally with the file system, or on the network with iCloudDisplay lists or collections of data with table views and collection viewsInteract with the outside world with Core Location and Core MotionUse blocks and operation queues for multiprocessing
