Book Description
-----------------

Any employee can sue any employer at any time, and for just about any reason. There is no such thing as a bulletproof personnel decision. It's no wonder businesses fear lawsuits from employees—they are costly in terms of time, money, and distraction.   
But fear not. The Employer Bill of Rights: A Manager's Guide to Workplace Law is a practical handbook designed to help managers and business owners navigate the ever-changing maze of labor and employment laws, rules, and regulations. Following its practical guidelines will help you deter most lawsuits and place you in the best possible position to defend those that ultimately are filed.
Your expert guide, employment attorney Jonathan T. Hyman, shows you how to assert your rights to protect your investment in people, operations, facilities, and other assets—all with any eye to maintaining a more productive, harmonious, and profitable workplace. In addition, The Employer Bill of Rights:
Explains in practical and plain language the key legal issues that managers face on a daily basis in managing their employees.
Describes how to make personnel decisions that will help you avoid costly litigation.
Explains the who, what, why, when, where, and how of each of the major federal employment discrimination acts.
Tackles cutting-edge human resources issues such as wage-and-hour disputes and managing social media in the workplace.
Shows how to hire and fire employee without the fear of an expensive discrimination lawsuit.

Shows why you should follow the Golden Rule in all personnel matters with your employees.
No personnel decision or policy is litigation-proof, but The Employer Bill of Rights: A Manager's Guide to Workplace Law will help you make informed decisions to hedge against and avoid the biggest blunders and errors that too often result in expensive and time-consuming lawsuits.

Who this book is for
The Employer Bill of Rights: A Manager's Guide to Workplace Law targets the owners of small to mid-size businesses and the managers that work in them. These businesses usually lack a dedicated in-house counsel responsible for, or knowledgeable in, labor and employment law. They often may also lack a human resources department. Without these internal resources, such businesses often shoot from the hip when making hiring, firing, pay, and other personnel decisions. Because of the intricacies and nuances of the ever-changing world of labor and employment law, these decisions can lead to costly mistakes. This book ensures that each personnel decision is made with the law—and the company's best interests—in mind.
