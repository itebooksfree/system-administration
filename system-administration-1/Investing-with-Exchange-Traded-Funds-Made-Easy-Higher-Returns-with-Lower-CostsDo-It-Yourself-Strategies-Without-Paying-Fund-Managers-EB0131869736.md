“Do not hesitate to buy this book, it will make you money!”
            --Ike Iossif,President/Chief Investment Officer,Aegean Capital Group, Inc.

Now, one of the field's leading experts cuts through the ETF hype, offering a start-to-finish plan for choosing the right ETFs and using them to beat the market, year after year.
Dr. Marvin Appel explains exactly how ETFs work, what they can and cannot do, and why they’re not all equally attractive. Then, drawing on objective data and proven, back-tested strategies, he shows you how you can quickly move into the right ETFs at the right time, consistently staying on the winning side of major market trends.
Appel illuminates every facet of ETF investing: quantifying potential risk and reward, using ETFs to improve diversification, implementing simple ”active strategies,” deciding when to move into cash, and more. He also presents a full chapter on international ETF investing, as well as a discussion on how ETF investing can reduce your taxes.
From start to finish, this book candidly assesses risks, costs, and rewards, helping you become an informed ETF consumer and a powerfully effective ETF investor.
