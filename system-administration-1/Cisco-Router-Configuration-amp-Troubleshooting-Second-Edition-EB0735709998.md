Book Description
-----------------

Cisco Router Configuration and Troubleshooting, 2nd Edition is a reference for you, the network and system administrator who finds yourself having to configure and maintain existing Cisco routers as well as get new hardware up and running. The authors begins by touching on the foundation behind routing technology: networks, protocols and hardware. Then they jump right into router configuration, discussing setup, local and wide area networking, security and monitoring. The troubleshooting section uses a fictitious company to illustrate the differenct scenarios and administrator might encounter. It includes situations that deal with Cisco routers and well as hardware from other companies, mimicking the heterogeneous environment most administrators face. The author also introduces a troubleshooting methodology to help you implement the suggested practices in the book. This section covers the physical and network layer, as well as the protocols involved in routing technologies.
