Book Description
-----------------

Optical Network Control is the first expert guide and single-source reference for controlling and managing optical networks. This book fills the gap between optical network engineering and routing/signaling—helping both optical and IP professionals build networks that are more robust, flexible, manageable, and profitable. Coverage includes:
Designing networks to deliver a range of on-demand services from mission-critical, time-sensitive protected services to low-cost unprotected services
Network control and operations in WDM/DWDM and SONET/SDH environments
Control principles and features for evolving mesh-based optical networks and existing ring networks—with practical examples
Emerging, proposed, and future optical routing/signaling protocols and standards including GMPLS, ASON and Optical UNI
Optical network control planes: design, scenarios, interworking, and interactions with existing network management systems
Crucial IETF, ITU-T, OIF, ANSI, Bellcore, and industry information—brought together for the first time
