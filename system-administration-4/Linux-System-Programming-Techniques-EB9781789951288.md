Book Description
-----------------

Find solutions to all your problems related to Linux system programming using practical recipes for developing your own system programs
Key FeaturesDevelop a deeper understanding of how Linux system programming worksGain hands-on experience of working with different Linux projects with the help of practical examplesLearn how to develop your own programs for LinuxLinux is the world's most popular open source operating system (OS). Linux System Programming Techniques will enable you to extend the Linux OS with your own system programs and communicate with other programs on the system.
The book begins by exploring the Linux filesystem, its basic commands, built-in manual pages, the GNU compiler collection (GCC), and Linux system calls. You'll then discover how to handle errors in your programs and will learn to catch errors and print relevant information about them. The book takes you through multiple recipes on how to read and write files on the system, using both streams and file descriptors. As you advance, you'll delve into forking, creating zombie processes, and daemons, along with recipes on how to handle daemons using systemd. After this, you'll find out how to create shared libraries and start exploring different types of interprocess communication (IPC). In the later chapters, recipes on how to write programs using POSIX threads and how to debug your programs using the GNU debugger (GDB) and Valgrind will also be covered.
By the end of this Linux book, you will be able to develop your own system programs for Linux, including daemons, tools, clients, and filters.
What you will learnDiscover how to write programs for the Linux system using a wide variety of system callsDelve into the working of POSIX functionsUnderstand and use key concepts such as signals, pipes, IPC, and process managementFind out how to integrate programs with a Linux systemExplore advanced topics such as filesystem operations, creating shared libraries, and debugging your programsGain an overall understanding of how to debug your programs using ValgrindWho this book is forThis book is for anyone who wants to develop system programs for Linux and gain a deeper understanding of the Linux system.
