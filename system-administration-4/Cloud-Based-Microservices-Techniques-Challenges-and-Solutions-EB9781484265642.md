Book Description
-----------------

Use this field guide as you transform your enterprise to combine cloud computing with a microservices architecture.
The recent surge in the popularity of microservices in software development is mainly due to the agility it brings and its readiness for the cloud. The move to a microservices architecture on the cloud involves a gradual evolution in software development. Many enterprises are embarking on this journey, and are now looking for architects who are experienced in building microservices-based applications in the cloud.
A master architect should be able to understand the business, identify growth hurdles, break a monolith, design microservices, foresee problems, overcome challenges, change processes, decipher CSP services, strategize cloudification, adopt innovations, secure microservices, prototype solutions, and envision the future. Cloud-Based Microservices provides you with the information you need to be successful in such an endeavor.
