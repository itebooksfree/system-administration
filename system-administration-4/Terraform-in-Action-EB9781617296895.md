Book Description
-----------------

Terraform in Action shows you how to automate and scale infrastructure programmatically using the Terraform toolkit. Using practical, relevant examples, you’ll use Terraform to provision a Kubernetes cluster, deploy a multiplayer game, and configure other hands-on projects. As you progress to advanced techniques like zero-downtime deployments, you’ll discover how to think in Terraform rather than just copying and pasting scripts.
