Book Description
-----------------

For beginning and experienced network engineers tasked with building LAN, WAN, and data center connections, this book lays out clear directions for installing, configuring, and troubleshooting networks with Cisco devices.&nbsp;Cisco Networks, 2nd Edition&nbsp;is a practical guide and desk reference for Cisco engineers. This new edition will discuss tools that can be used to automate and troubleshoot networks.&nbsp;A new chapter on quality of service has been added to teach managing network resources by prioritizing specific types of network traffic. The new edition has an updated wireless section which focuses on an updated controller and integration with Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and Cisco Prime Infrastructure.
This practical desk companion doubles as a comprehensive overview of the basic knowledge and skills needed by CCNA and CCNP exam takers. Prior familiarity with Cisco routing and switching is desirable but not necessary, as Chris Carthern, Dr. Will Wilson, and Noel Rivera start their book with a review of network basics. Further they explain practical considerations and troubleshooting when establishing a physical medium for network communications.&nbsp;Later they explain the concept of network layers, intermediate LAN switching, and routing. Next they introduce you to the tools and automation used with Cisco networks. Moving forward they explain management planes, data planes, and control planes. Next they describe advanced security, trouble shooting, and network management. They conclude the book with a section which focuses on&nbsp;using network automation to automate Cisco IOS networks.
