Book Description
-----------------

Master the foundations of modern Cisco Unified Communications (UC) system security
This guide helps you build foundational knowledge for securing modern Cisco Unified Communications environments that support voice, video, messaging, and meetings, and support different types of real-time collaboration capabilities based on mobile/remote access and mobile devices based on bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives.
Writing for administrators and managers, two Cisco collaboration experts bring together methods and insights to illuminate both the why and the how of effective collaboration security. Using the proven Explain, Demonstrate, and Verify methodology, they explain each threat, demonstrate remediation, and show how to confirm correct implementation. Youll walk through securing each attack surface in a logical progression, across each Cisco UC application domain.
The authors address key updates to Cisco collaboration architecture, including Expressway, Cisco Meeting Server, encryption enhancements, and advanced business-to-business collaboration. Youll find quick-reference checklists in each chapter, and links to more detail wherever needed.
