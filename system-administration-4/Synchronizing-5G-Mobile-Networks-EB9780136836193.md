Book Description
-----------------

The complete guide to timing and synchronization in advanced service provider networks and enterprise applications As networks have advanced, so has the need for precise timing and synchronization--including highly accurate phase synchronization. Without it, networks become increasingly vulnerable to outages, data loss events, and inefficiencies that can be notoriously difficult to diagnose. 5G telecom networks have especially stringent requirements, but they also apply to a growing number of enterprise applications in finance, factory automation, IoT, media, and beyond.
Synchronizing 5G Mobile Networks is the definitive, comprehensive guide to all aspects of timing and synchronization. Drawing on extensive experience developing and implementing timing and synchronization systems, three leading experts cover standards, protocols, clock design, architecture, solution design, deployment tradeoffs, day-to-day operations, troubleshooting, and more.
This book will be valuable to professionals with diverse backgrounds, even those with no timing or synchronization experience. It will be especially useful to engineers and consultants designing or implementing mobile networks; test engineers validating equipment or production solutions; students seeking careers with service providers or in advanced private networks; and technology leaders seeking to understand the growing role of time synchronization.
