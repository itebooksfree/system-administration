Book Description
-----------------

      Learn about the latest in cognitive and autonomous network management Towards Cognitive Autonomous Networks: Network Management Automation for 5G and Beyond delivers a comprehensive understanding of the current state-of-the-art in cognitive and autonomous network operation. Authors Mwanje and Bell fully describe today's capabilities while explaining the future potential of these powerful technologies. This book advocates for autonomy in new 5G networks, arguing that the virtualization of network functions render autonomy an absolute necessity. Following that, the authors move on to comprehensively explain the background and history of large networks, and how we come to find ourselves in the place we're in now. Towards Cognitive Autonomous Networks describes several novel techniques and applications of cognition and autonomy required for end-to-end cognition including: • Configuration of autonomous networks • Operation of autonomous networks • Optimization of autonomous networks • Self-healing autonomous networks The book concludes with an examination of the extensive challenges facing completely autonomous networks now and in the future.
