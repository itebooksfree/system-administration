Book Description
-----------------

With IBM® Spectrum Virtualize and the Object-Based Access Control, you can implement multi-tenancy and secure storage usage in a Red Hat OpenShift environment. 
This IBM Redpaper® publication shows you how to secure the storage usage from the Openshift user to the IBM Spectrum® Virtualize array. You see how to restrict storage usage in a Red Hat Openshift Container Platform to avoid the over-consumption of storage by one or more user. These uses cases can be expanded to the use of this control to provide assistance with billing.
