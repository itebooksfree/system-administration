Book Description
-----------------


    
    
    Look beyond the basics of Mac programming and development to become a Mac power user. When most people think about the Mac, they think about the amazing graphical user interface macOS is known for. However, there is a whole world to explore beneath the hood. This book approaches working directly in the terminal with fun projects and ideas to help turn you into an advanced Mac user.&nbsp;You'll work with Brew (HomeBrew), which gives you the ability to install applications from Linux (and Unix) that can make the terminal more useful. This is important, because a lot of applications have been stripped out of macOS or deprecated.  For example, Apple's built-in PHP is usually a major release behind. You'll also customize your terminal to change everything about it, making it your own. The whole world is about personalizing.  Why put up with the Apple defaults? &nbsp;Once you have your terminal set up and ready to rock, you'll review the basics of programming on the Mac terminal.  This will allow you to get a taste of power scripting.  You'll discover the power of bash, PHP, and Python. &nbsp;And then you'll apply those tools to web development.&nbsp;Tweak Your Mac Terminal&nbsp;takes you on a journey into a world of the terminal and its hidden applications.&nbsp;
