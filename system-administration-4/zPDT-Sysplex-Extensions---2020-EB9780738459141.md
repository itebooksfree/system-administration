Book Description
-----------------

This IBM® Redbooks® publication describes the IBM System z® Personal Development Tool (IBM zPDT®) Sysplex Extensions 2020, which is a package that consists of sample files and supporting documentation to help you get a functioning, data sharing sysplex up and running with minimal time and effort. This book is a significant revision of zPDT 2017 Sysplex Extensions, SG24-8386.
This package is designed and tested to be installed on top of a standard Application Developer Controlled Distribution (ADCD) environment. It provides the extra files that you need to create a two-way data sharing IBM z/OS® 2.4 sysplex that runs under IBM z/VM® in a zPDT environment.
This package differs from the zPDT sysplex package delivered in IBM zPDT Guide and Reference System z Personal Development Tool, SG24-8205, in that it provides working examples of more sysplex exploiters. It also is designed to adhere to IBM's sysplex best practice recommendations, in as far as is possible in a zPDT environment.
Although the package was not tested with IBM Z® Development and Test Environment (previously known as RD&amp;T), it may be used to reduce the effort to create a fully functional sysplex under zD&amp;T.
Conceptually, the package might also be restored and used as a template to create a sysplex environment that is running on a real IBM Z CPC.
The target audience for this document is system programmers who are responsible for designing, creating, and maintaining IBM Parallel Sysplex® environments. It can also be beneficial to developers who currently maintain their own ADCD environments and want to extend them to add sysplex functions.
