Book Description
-----------------

Master the day-to-day administration and maintenance procedures for existing VXLAN fabrics. In this book you’ll discuss common issues and troubleshooting steps to help you keep your environment in stable operation. The Fast-Track Guide to VXLAN BGP EVPN Fabrics is a guide for network engineers and architects who can’t spend too much time learning everything about VXLAN. It has been created with the end goal of providing you with a straightforward approach to understand, implement, administer, and maintain VXLAN BGP EVPN-based data center networks.&nbsp;
Using this book, you will understand Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) as a technology that combines network virtualization and service provider class network attributes to solve the performance and scalability limitations in a three-tier design. You will learn to combine multiple links and provide equal-cost multipathing to effortlessly scale speed requirements without being worried about potential loops. 
You will learn VXLAN BGP EVPN configuration procedures with graphical step-by-step examples. You will be introduced to foundational concepts in VXLAN without the need to go over hundreds of documentation pages. This book is a clear and precise guide to implementing a spine and leaf architecture running with VXLAN. It explains how to perform day-to-day maintenance and administration tasks after implementing your first VXLAN fabric. It also explains how to integrate external devices such as firewalls, routers, and load balancers to VXLAN; how to leverage your VXLAN fabric; and how to create multiple tenant networks to secure your critical infrastructure.&nbsp;
