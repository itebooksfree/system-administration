Book Description
-----------------

Understand the fundamentals of Kubernetes deployment on Azure with a learn-by-doing approach
Key FeaturesGet to grips with the fundamentals of containers and KubernetesDeploy containerized applications using the Kubernetes platformLearn how you can scale your workloads and secure your application running in Azure Kubernetes ServiceContainers and Kubernetes containers facilitate cloud deployments and application development by enabling efficient versioning with improved security and portability.
With updated chapters on role-based access control, pod identity, storing secrets, and network security in AKS, this third edition begins by introducing you to containers, Kubernetes, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and guides you through deploying an AKS cluster in different ways. You will then delve into the specifics of Kubernetes by deploying a sample guestbook application on AKS and installing complex Kubernetes apps using Helm. With the help of real-world examples, you'll also get to grips with scaling your applications and clusters.
As you advance, you'll learn how to overcome common challenges in AKS and secure your applications with HTTPS. You will also learn how to secure your clusters and applications in a dedicated section on security. In the final section, you'll learn about advanced integrations, which give you the ability to create Azure databases and run serverless functions on AKS as well as the ability to integrate AKS with a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions.
By the end of this Kubernetes book, you will be proficient in deploying containerized workloads on Microsoft Azure with minimal management overhead.
What you will learnPlan, configure, and run containerized applications in production.Use Docker to build applications in containers and deploy them on Kubernetes.Monitor the AKS cluster and the application.Monitor your infrastructure and applications in Kubernetes using Azure Monitor.Secure your cluster and applications using Azure-native security tools.Connect an app to the Azure database.Store your container images securely with Azure Container Registry.Install complex Kubernetes applications using Helm.Integrate Kubernetes with multiple Azure PaaS services, such as databases, Azure Security Center, and Functions.Use GitHub Actions to perform continuous integration and continuous delivery to your cluster.Who this book is forIf you are an aspiring DevOps professional, system administrator, developer, or site reliability engineer interested in learning how to get the most out of containers and Kubernetes, then this book is for you.
