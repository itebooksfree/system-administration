Book Description
-----------------

This IBM® Redbooks® publication is volume one of five in a series of books entitled The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z. 
The series includes the following volume:
The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM z Systems® Volume 1: IBM z/VM® 7.2, SG24-8147The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z Volume 2: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Servers, SG24-8303The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM z Systems Volume 3: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12, SG24-8890The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM z Systems Volume 4: Ubuntu Server 16.04, SG24-8354Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z Volume 5: KVM, SG24-8463It is recommended that you start with Volume 1 of this series because the IBM z/VM hypervisor is the foundation (or base "layer") for installing Linux on IBM Z®.This book series assumes that you are generally familiar with IBM Z technology and terminology. It does not assume an in-depth understanding of z/VM or Linux. It is written for individuals who want to start quickly with z/VM and Linux, and get virtual servers up and running in a short time (days, not weeks or months).
Volume 1 starts with a solution orientation, discusses planning and security, and then, describes z/VM installation methods, configuration, hardening, automation, servicing, networking, optional features, and more. 
It adopts a "cookbook-style" format that provides a concise, repeatable set of procedures for installing, configuring, administering, and maintaining z/VM. This volume also includes a chapter on monitoring z/VM and the Linux virtual servers that are hosted.
Volumes 2, 3, and 4 assume that you completed all of the steps that are described in Volume 1. From that common foundation, these volumes describe how to create your own Linux virtual servers on IBM Z hardware under IBM z/VM. The cookbook format continues with installing and customizing Linux.
Volume 5 provides an explanation of the kernel-based virtual machine (KVM) on IBM Z and how it can use the z/Architecture®. It focuses on the planning of the environment and provides installation and configuration definitions that are necessary to build, manage, and monitor a KVM on Z environment. This publication applies to the supported Linux on Z distributions (Red Hat, SUSE, and Ubuntu).
