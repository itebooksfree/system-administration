Book Description
-----------------

As data privacy, security, and regulatory compliance become more important, multitenant SaaS gets tricky. Many enterprises need solutions that provide more comprehensive control over their data, but fully on-premises software has limitations. A hybrid approach, dubbed "multi-prem," brings cloud native technologies to a company-controlled infrastructure, offering some of the advantages of on-premises deployment along with the scalability of cloud native applications.
Multi-Prem Software
                explains how Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies are changing on-premises software delivery, alleviating some of the challenges of packaging and deploying applications to diverse environments. You'll discover how this model allows you to:
            
Manage application installation, maintenance, upgrades, and operationsBring automation, uniformity, scalability, and observability to software deployment and managementGive customers the ability to manage your proprietary software using their DevOps pipelinePackage cloud native applications for multiple customer environments, including on-premises, private clouds, and air-gapped serversSolve the data management, security, and regulatory challenges of the cloud by giving the enterprise control over the environment where the application runs
