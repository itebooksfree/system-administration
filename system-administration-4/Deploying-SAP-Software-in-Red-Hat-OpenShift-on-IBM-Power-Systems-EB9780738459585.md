Book Description
-----------------

This IBM® Redpaper publication documents how to containerize and deploy SAP software into Red Hat OpenShift 4 Kubernetes clusters on IBM Power Systems by using predefined Red Hat Ansible scripts, different configurations, and theoretical knowledge, and it documents the findings through sample scenarios.
This paper documents the following topics:
Running SAP S/4HANA, SAP HANA, and SAP NetWeaver on-premises software in containers that are deployed in Red Hat OpenShift 4 on IBM Power Systems hardware. Existing SAP systems running on IBM Power Systems can be repackaged at customer sites into containers that use predefined Red Hat Ansible scripts.These containers can be deployed multiple times into Red Hat OpenShift 4 Kubernetes clusters on IBM Power Systems.The target audiences for this paper are Chief Information Officers (CIOs) that are interested in containerized solutions of SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, developers that need containerized environments, and system administrators that provide and manage the infrastructure with underpinning automation.
