Book Description
-----------------


    
    Observability is critical for engineering, managing, and improving complex business-critical systems. Through this process, any software engineering team can gain a deeper understanding of system performance, so you can perform ongoing maintenance and ship the features your customers need. This practical book explains the value of observable systems and shows you how to build an observability-driven development practice.
Authors Charity Majors and Liz Fong-Jones from Honeycomb explain what constitutes good observability, show you how to make improvements from what you’re doing today, and provide practical dos and don’ts for migrating from legacy tooling, such as metrics monitoring and log management. You’ll also learn the impact observability has on organization culture.
You’ll explore:
The value of practicing observability when delivering and managing complex cloud native applications and systemsThe impact observability has across the entire software engineering cycleSoftware ownership: how different functional teams help achieve system SLOsHow software developers contribute to customer experience and business impactHow to produce quality code for context-aware system debugging and maintenanceHow data-rich analytics can help you find answers quickly when maintaining site reliability
