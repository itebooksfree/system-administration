Book Description
-----------------

Enhance Linux security, application platforms, and virtualization solutions with SELinux 3 to work within your boundaries, your rules, and your policies
Key FeaturesLearn what SELinux is, and how it acts as a mandatory access control system on LinuxApply and tune SELinux enforcement to users, applications, platforms, and virtualization solutionsUse real-life examples and custom policies to strengthen the security posture of your systemsLinux is a dominant player in many organizations and in the cloud. Securing the Linux environment is extremely important for any organization, and Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) acts as an additional layer to Linux system security.
SELinux System Administration covers basic SELinux concepts and shows you how to enhance Linux system protection measures. You will get to grips with SELinux and understand how it is integrated. As you progress, you'll get hands-on experience of tuning and configuring SELinux and integrating it into day-to-day administration tasks such as user management, network management, and application maintenance. Platforms such as Kubernetes, system services like systemd, and virtualization solutions like libvirt and Xen, all of which offer SELinux-specific controls, will be explained effectively so that you understand how to apply and configure SELinux within these applications. If applications do not exert the expected behavior, you'll learn how to fine-tune policies to securely host these applications. In case no policies exist, the book will guide you through developing custom policies on your own.
By the end of this Linux book, you'll be able to harden any Linux system using SELinux to suit your needs and fine-tune existing policies and develop custom ones to protect any app and service running on your Linux systems.
What you will learnUnderstand what SELinux is and how it is integrated into LinuxTune Linux security using policies and their configurable settingsManage Linux users with least-privilege roles and access controlsUse SELinux controls in system services and virtualization solutionsAnalyze SELinux behavior through log events and policy analysis toolsProtect systems against unexpected and malicious behaviorEnhance existing policies or develop custom onesWho this book is forThis Linux sysadmin book is for Linux administrators who want to control the secure state of their systems using SELinux, and for security professionals who have experience in maintaining a Linux system and want to know about SELinux. Experience in maintaining Linux systems, covering user management, software installation and maintenance, Linux security controls, and network configuration is required to get the most out of this book.
