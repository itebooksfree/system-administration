Book Description
-----------------

Multicloud loosely describes an organization's use of more than one cloud provider, but the term doesn't reveal much beyond that. The polycloud model, on the other hand, addresses the recent trend by cloud providers to add differentiated capabilities that allow organizations to use different cloud providers for different purposes. Many organizations adopting a cloud strategy today are pursuing services that fit the new polycloud model.
In this report, recognized industry thought leader Lee Atchison describes what polycloud is and how it compares to and differs from other cloud architectural models, including multicloud. C-suite and engineering executives will learn where, when, and how to take advantage of the polycloud paradigm. You'll also learn when to specifically avoid using it.
Understand the advantages and disadvantages of using a polycloud architectureExplore examples of polycloud architectures for fictitious applicationsReview guidelines that can help you be successful with a polycloud architectural strategyLearn how to improve availability in a polycloud environmentExplore examples of service-differentiated polycloud architecturesDecide when you should use a polycloud rather than a multicloud or single cloud environment
