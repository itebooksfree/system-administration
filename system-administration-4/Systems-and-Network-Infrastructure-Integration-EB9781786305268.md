Book Description
-----------------

      IT infrastructures are now essential in all areas and sectors of human activity; they are the cornerstone of any information system. Thus, it is clear that the greatest of care must be given to their design, implementation, security and supervision in order to ensure optimum functionality and better performance. Within this context, Systems and Network Infrastructure Integration presents the methodological and theoretical principles necessary to successfully carry out an integration project for network and systems infrastructures. This book is aimed at anyone interested in the field of networks in general. In particular, it is intended for students of fields relating to networks and computer systems who are called upon to integrate their knowledge and skills, gained throughout their academic study, into a comprehensive project to set up a complete infrastructure, while respecting the necessary specifications.
