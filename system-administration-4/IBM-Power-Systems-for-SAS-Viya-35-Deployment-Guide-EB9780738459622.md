Book Description
-----------------

This IBM® Redbooks® publication provides options and best practices for deploying SAS Viya 3.5 on IBM POWER9™ servers.
SAS Viya is a complex set of artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics solutions that require a properly planned infrastructure to meet the needs of the data scientists, business analysts, and application developers who use Viya capabilities in their daily work activities. 
Regardless of the user role, the underlying infrastructure matters to ensure performance expectations and service level agreement (SLA) requirements are met or exceeded. Although the general planning process is similar for deploying SAS Viya on any platform, key IBM POWER9 differentiators must be considered to ensure that an optimized infrastructure deployment is achieved. 
This guide provides useful information that is needed during the planning, sizing, ordering, installing, configuring, and tuning phases of your SAS Viya deployment on POWER9 processor-based servers.
This book addresses topics for IT architects, IT specialists, developers, sellers, and anyone who wants to implement SAS Viya 3.5 on IBM POWER9 servers. Moreover, this publication provides documentation to transfer the how-to-skills to the technical teams, and solution guidance to the sales team. 
This book compliments the documentation that is available in IBM Knowledge Center and aligns with the educational materials that are provided by the IBM Systems Software Education (SSE).
