Book Description
-----------------

The IBM® DS8000® series includes the option to replace the locally based user ID and password authentication with a centralized directory-based approach. 
This IBM Redpaper publication helps DS8000 storage administrators understand the concepts and benefits of a centralized directory. It provides the information that is required for implementing a DS8000 authentication mechanism that is based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).
Starting with DS8000 Release 9.1 code, a simpler, native LDAP authentication method is supported along with the former implementation that relies on IBM Copy Services Manager (CSM) acting as a proxy between the DS8000 and external LDAP servers.
Note that examples and operations shown in this Redpaper refer to the DS8000 R9.1 SP1, code release bundle 89.11.33.0.
