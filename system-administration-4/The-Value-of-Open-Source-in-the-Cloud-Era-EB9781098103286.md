Book Description
-----------------

Two significant shifts characterize computing in the past two decades: the widespread use of free and open source software (FOSS) and migration to the cloud. How have these trends influenced one another? O'Reilly, in collaboration with IBM, conducted a survey of software development professionals during the fall of 2020 to discover the complex relationship between these two trends.
More than 3,400 respondents from a variety of software disciplines, including developers and  managers, indicated that FOSS is maintaining and perhaps even increasing its influence in the cloud age. The survey demonstrates that these professionals have a strong loyalty to open source software, which is motivated by real career benefits and greater professional opportunities. For instance, 95% of respondents agreed that experience with Linux was valuable to their career. And 70% of respondents prefer a cloud provider that's based on open source.
This report delves into more key survey findings, including:
The number of respondents who use open source software in some aspect of their operationsHow open source software stacks up against proprietary softwareThe career and professional benefits that open source technologies provideHow many respondents have chosen cloud providers based on their use of open source softwareThe software technologies that respondents consider most importantAnd more
