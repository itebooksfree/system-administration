Book Description
-----------------

Build a modern data platform by deploying SQL Server in Kubernetes. Modern application deployment needs to be fast and consistent to keep up with business objectives and Kubernetes is quickly becoming the standard for deploying container-based applications, fast. This book introduces Kubernetes and its core concepts. Then it shows you how to build and interact with a Kubernetes cluster. Next, it goes deep into deploying and operationalizing SQL Server in Kubernetes, both on premises and in cloud environments such as the Azure Cloud.You will begin with container-based application fundamentals and then go into an architectural overview of a Kubernetes container and how it manages application state. Then you will learn the hands-on skill of building a production-ready cluster. With your cluster up and running, you will learn how to interact with your cluster and perform common administrative tasks. Once you can admin the cluster, you will learn how to deploy applications and SQL Server in Kubernetes. You will learn about high-availability options, and about using Azure Arc-enabled Data Services. By the end of this book, you will know how to set up a Kubernetes cluster, manage a cluster, deploy applications and databases, and keep everything up and running.What You Will LearnUnderstand Kubernetes architecture and cluster componentsDeploy your applications into Kubernetes clustersManage your containers programmatically&nbsp;through API objects and controllersDeploy and operationalize SQL Server in KubernetesImplement high-availability SQL Server scenarios on Kubernetes using Azure Arc-enabled Data ServicesMake use of Kubernetes deployments for Big Data ClustersWho This Book Is ForDBAs and IT architects who are ready to begin planning their next-generation data platform and want to understand what it takes to run SQL Server in a container in Kubernetes. SQL Server on Kubernetes is an excellent choice for those who want to understand the big picture of why Kubernetes is the next-generation deployment method for SQL Server but also want to understand the internals, or the how, of deploying SQL Server in Kubernetes. When finished with this book, you will have the vision and skills to successfully architect, build and maintain a modern data platform deploying SQL Server on Kubernetes.
