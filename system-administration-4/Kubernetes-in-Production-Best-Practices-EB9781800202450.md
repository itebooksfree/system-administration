Book Description
-----------------

Design, build, and operate scalable and reliable Kubernetes infrastructure for production
Key FeaturesImplement industry best practices to build and manage production-grade Kubernetes infrastructureLearn how to architect scalable Kubernetes clusters, harden container security, and fine-tune resource managementUnderstand, manage, and operate complex business workloads confidentlyAlthough out-of-the-box solutions can help you to get a cluster up and running quickly, running a Kubernetes cluster that is optimized for production workloads is a challenge, especially for users with basic or intermediate knowledge. With detailed coverage of cloud industry standards and best practices for achieving scalability, availability, operational excellence, and cost optimization, this Kubernetes book is a blueprint for managing applications and services in production.
You'll discover the most common way to deploy and operate Kubernetes clusters, which is to use a public cloud-managed service from AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This book explores Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), the AWS-managed version of Kubernetes, for working through practical exercises. As you get to grips with implementation details specific to AWS and EKS, you'll understand the design concepts, implementation best practices, and configuration applicable to other cloud-managed services. Throughout the book, you'll also discover standard and cloud-agnostic tools, such as Terraform and Ansible, for provisioning and configuring infrastructure.
By the end of this book, you'll be able to leverage Kubernetes to operate and manage your production environments confidently.
What you will learnExplore different infrastructure architectures for Kubernetes deploymentImplement optimal open source and commercial storage management solutionsApply best practices for provisioning and configuring Kubernetes clusters, including infrastructure as code (IaC) and configuration as code (CAC)Configure the cluster networking plugin and core networking components to get the best out of themSecure your Kubernetes environment using the latest tools and best practicesDeploy core observability stacks, such as monitoring and logging, to fine-tune your infrastructureWho this book is forThis book is for cloud infrastructure experts, DevOps engineers, site reliability engineers, and engineering managers looking to design and operate Kubernetes infrastructure for production. Basic knowledge of Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Linux, and AWS is needed to get the most out of this book.
