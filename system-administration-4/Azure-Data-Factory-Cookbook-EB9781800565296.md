Book Description
-----------------

Solve real-world data problems and create data-driven workflows for easy data movement and processing at scale with Azure Data Factory
Key FeaturesLearn how to load and transform data from various sources, both on-premises and on cloudUse Azure Data Factory's visual environment to build and manage hybrid ETL pipelinesDiscover how to prepare, transform, process, and enrich data to generate key insightsAzure Data Factory (ADF) is a modern data integration tool available on Microsoft Azure. This Azure Data Factory Cookbook helps you get up and running by showing you how to create and execute your first job in ADF. You'll learn how to branch and chain activities, create custom activities, and schedule pipelines. This book will help you to discover the benefits of cloud data warehousing, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Azure Data Lake Gen2 Storage, which are frequently used for big data analytics. With practical recipes, you'll learn how to actively engage with analytical tools from Azure Data Services and leverage your on-premise infrastructure with cloud-native tools to get relevant business insights. As you advance, you'll be able to integrate the most commonly used Azure Services into ADF and understand how Azure services can be useful in designing ETL pipelines. The book will take you through the common errors that you may encounter while working with ADF and show you how to use the Azure portal to monitor pipelines.
