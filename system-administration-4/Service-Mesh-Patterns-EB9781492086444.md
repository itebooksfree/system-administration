Book Description
-----------------

As your organization adopts microservices, you also need a service mesh, the infrastructure layer that handles interservice communication in microservice architectures. This seminal book provides patterns and operational best practices to help you deploy and use service meshes in a way that meets your company's goals and needs.
Developers face a wide range of choices today: which service mesh to use, which features to deploy, and the best ways to exploit and deploy those features. Whether you're investigating service meshes or already use one, authors Lee Calcote and Nic Jackson provide universal patterns applicable to any service mesh: Istio, Linkerd, Consul, App Mesh, and more.
Get a vendor-neutral perspective on where each mesh shines (and perhaps, doesn't)Understand how service meshes benefit developers, operators, and service owners differentlyDetermine whether you're running your mesh effectivelyAvoid service mesh lock-in through use of service mesh abstractionsLearn common deployment patterns for implementing a specific service mesh functionUse configuration best practices to avoid common pitfallsExplore federation of service mesh deployments and other service mesh typesAs microservices proliferate your environment, fear not: service meshes are here to manage your service sprawl. This book shows you how.
