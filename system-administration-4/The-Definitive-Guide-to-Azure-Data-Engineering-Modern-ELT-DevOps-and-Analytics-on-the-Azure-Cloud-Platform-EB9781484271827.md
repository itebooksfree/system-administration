Book Description
-----------------

Build efficient and scalable batch and real-time data ingestion pipelines, DevOps continuous integration and deployment pipelines, and advanced analytics solutions on the Azure Data Platform. This book teaches you to design and implement robust data engineering solutions using Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse Analytics, Snowflake, Azure SQL database, Stream Analytics, Cosmos database, and Data Lake Storage Gen2. You will learn how to engineer your use of these Azure Data Platform components for optimal performance and scalability. You will also learn to design self-service capabilities to maintain and drive the pipelines and your workloads.&nbsp;The approach in this book is to guide you through a hands-on, scenario-based learning process that will empower you to promote digital innovation best practices while you work through your organizationâ€™s projects, challenges, and needs. The clear examples enable you to use this book as a reference and guide for building data engineering solutions in Azure. After reading this book, you will have a far stronger skill set and confidence level in getting hands on with the Azure Data Platform.What You Will LearnBuild dynamic, parameterized ELT data ingestion orchestration pipelines in Azure Data FactoryCreate data ingestion pipelines that integrate control tables for self-service ELTImplement a reusable logging framework that can be applied to multiple pipelinesIntegrate Azure Data Factory pipelines with a variety of Azure data sources and toolsTransform data with Mapping Data Flows in Azure Data FactoryApply Azure DevOps continuous integration and deployment practices to your Azure Data Factory pipelines and development SQL databasesDesign and implement real-time streaming and advanced analytics solutions using Databricks, Stream Analytics, and Synapse AnalyticsGet started with a variety of Azure data services through hands-on examplesWho This Book Is ForData engineers and data architects who are interested in learning architectural and engineering best practices around ELT and ETL on the Azure Data Platform, those who are creating complex Azure data engineering projects and are searching for patterns of success, and aspiring cloud and data professionals involved in data engineering, data governance, continuous integration and deployment of DevOps practices, and advanced analytics who want a full understanding of the many different tools and technologies that Azure Data Platform provides
