Book Description
-----------------

Kubernetes Networking is an essential guide for anyone who wants to deploy, manage, or troubleshoot a production-scale Kubernetes network.
Understanding Kubernetes clusters isn't enough to operate Kubernetes at scale. Every layer of the stack--the network, operating system, and Kubernetes--depends on the layer below. Successful administrators need to understand each layer and how it works across deployments on-premises, in the cloud, and with managed services. Kubernetes Networking clearly guides administrators through the layers of complexity and abstraction that come with running a Kubernetes network. It covers:
The Kubernetes networking modelThe CNCF Container Network Interface Project and how to choose the best interface for your clustersThe networking and Linux primitives that power KubernetesHow to quickly troubleshoot networking issues and prevent downtimeCloud networking and Kubernetes with the three major providers: AWS, GCP, and AzureThe pros and cons of various network tools--and how to select the best ones for your stack
