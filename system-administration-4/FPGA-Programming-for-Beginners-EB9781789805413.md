Book Description
-----------------

Get started with FPGA programming using SystemVerilog, and develop real-world skills by building projects, including a calculator and a keyboard
Key FeaturesExplore different FPGA usage methods and the FPGA tool flowLearn how to design, test, and implement hardware circuits using SystemVerilogBuild real-world FPGA projects such as a calculator and a keyboard using FPGA resourcesField Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have now become a core part of most modern electronic and computer systems. However, to implement your ideas in the real world, you need to get your head around the FPGA architecture, its toolset, and critical design considerations. FPGA Programming for Beginners will help you bring your ideas to life by guiding you through the entire process of programming FPGAs and designing hardware circuits using SystemVerilog.
The book will introduce you to the FPGA and Xilinx architectures and show you how to work on your first project, which includes toggling an LED. You'll then cover SystemVerilog RTL designs and their implementations. Next, you'll get to grips with using the combinational Boolean logic design and work on several projects, such as creating a calculator and updating it using FPGA resources. Later, the book will take you through the advanced concepts of AXI and serial interfaces and show you how to create a keyboard using PS/2. Finally, you'll be able to consolidate all the projects in the book to create a unified output using a Video Graphics Array (VGA) controller that you'll design.
By the end of this SystemVerilog FPGA book, you'll have learned how to work with FPGA systems and be able to design hardware circuits and boards using SystemVerilog programming.
