Book Description
-----------------

Learn how to write high-quality kernel module code, solve common Linux kernel programming issues, and understand the fundamentals of Linux kernel internals
Key FeaturesDiscover how to write kernel code using the Loadable Kernel Module frameworkExplore industry-grade techniques to perform efficient memory allocation and data synchronization within the kernelUnderstand the essentials of key internals topics such as kernel architecture, memory management, CPU scheduling, and kernel synchronizationLinux Kernel Programming is a comprehensive introduction for those new to Linux kernel and module development. This easy-to-follow guide will have you up and running with writing kernel code in next-to-no time. This book uses the latest 5.4 Long-Term Support (LTS) Linux kernel, which will be maintained from November 2019 through to December 2025. By working with the 5.4 LTS kernel throughout the book, you can be confident that your knowledge will continue to be valid for years to come.
This Linux book begins by showing you how to build the kernel from the source. Next, you'll learn how to write your first kernel module using the powerful Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) framework. The book then covers key kernel internals topics including Linux kernel architecture, memory management, and CPU scheduling. Next, you'll delve into the fairly complex topic of concurrency within the kernel, understand the issues it can cause, and learn how they can be addressed with various locking technologies (mutexes, spinlocks, atomic, and refcount operators). You'll also benefit from more advanced material on cache effects, a primer on lock-free techniques within the kernel, deadlock avoidance (with lockdep), and kernel lock debugging techniques.
By the end of this kernel book, you'll have a detailed understanding of the fundamentals of writing Linux kernel module code for real-world projects and products.
What you will learnWrite high-quality modular kernel code (LKM framework) for 5.x kernelsConfigure and build a kernel from sourceExplore the Linux kernel architectureGet to grips with key internals regarding memory management within the kernelUnderstand and work with various dynamic kernel memory alloc/dealloc APIsDiscover key internals aspects regarding CPU scheduling within the kernelGain an understanding of kernel concurrency issuesFind out how to work with key kernel synchronization primitivesWho this book is forThis book is for Linux programmers beginning to find their way with Linux kernel development. Linux kernel and driver developers looking to overcome frequent and common kernel development issues, as well as understand kernel internals, will benefit from this book. A basic understanding of Linux CLI and C programming is required.
