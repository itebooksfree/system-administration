Book Description
-----------------

Extensively updated evaluation of current and future network technologies, applications and devices
This book follows on from its successful predecessor with an introduction to next generation network technologies, mobile devices, voice and multimedia services and the mobile web 2.0. Giving a sound technical introduction to 3GPP wireless systems, this book explains the decisions taken during standardization of the most popular wireless network standards today, LTE, LTE-Advanced and HSPA+. It discusses how these elements strongly influence each other and how network capabilities, available bandwidth, mobile device capabilities and new application concepts will shape the way we communicate in the future. This Second Edition presents a comprehensive and broad-reaching examination of a fast-moving technology which will be a welcome update for researchers and professionals alike.
Key features:
Fully updated and expanded to include new sections including VoLTE, the evolution to 4G, mobile Internet access, LTE-Advanced, Wi-Fi security and backhaul for wireless networks
Describes the successful commercialization of Web 2.0 services such as Facebook, and the emergence of app stores, tablets and smartphones
Examines the evolution of mobile devices and operating systems, including ARM and x86 architecture and their application to voice-optimized and multimedia devices
